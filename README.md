#Final Project

#I'm Hungry and Indecisive... what should I eat?

So you don't know what to eat? I see... Let me ask you a couple of questions to eliminate some options and then you can either see our list or choose to "Roll the dice" and get a random option.

Happy eating!

#User Flow:

- Sobriety Options
- Answer 5 questions about the qualities of food the user is looking for:
	- Hot or Cold
	- Sweet or Savory
	- Chewy or Crunchy
	- Utensils or None
	- Healthy or Not
- Either select to see options or "Roll the Dice"
- Get eating!

#Psuedocode:

- A list of lists/dictionaries will hold the possible outcomes and the qualities that are associated with them.

- The user questions will be if/else statements that will eliminate options from the main list of outcomes.

- The outcomes will either be printed at the user's request or one outcome will be printed at random by "rolling the dice".

- At any point during the qualities questions, the user could type "fuck this" and the program will just print a random outcome based on their most recent answer.
Skills used: lists, dictionaries, modules, conditionals.
